## âœ¨ About This Study

Undergraduate students, especially those in STEM, are often under high academic stress. Our project explores how **fieldâ€‘based courses** and handsâ€‘on, outdoor learning environments influence:

- **Student engagement**  
- **Perceived learning**  
- **Mental wellâ€‘being and selfâ€‘efficacy**  

These materials support transparent reporting and reproducibility of our qualitative and quantitative analyses.
